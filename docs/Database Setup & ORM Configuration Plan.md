    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

```bash
yarn add -D ts-node
npx prisma db seed
```

### Phase 5: Database Service Layer (45 minutes) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 5.1 Create Database Service

**Core Methods to implement:**
- **Game Operations**: createGame, findGameByRoomCode, updateGameState
- **Player Operations**: addPlayerToGame, updatePlayerHand, setCurrentTurn
- **Card Operations**: getRandomCards, getCardById
- **Timeline Operations**: addCardToTimeline, getTimelineForGame
- **Utility Operations**: getGameWithPlayers, cleanupInactiveGames

**Features:**
- Type-safe Prisma client usage
- Proper error handling
- Connection management
- Query optimization with includes

#### 5.2 Create Type Definitions
**File:** `src/types/database.ts`

**Types to define:**
- Extended types with relations (GameWithPlayers, PlayerWithGame)
- Game state interface
- API response types
- Import Prisma-generated types

### Phase 6: Redis Setup (30 minutes) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 6.1 Install Redis Dependencies
```bash
yarn add redis
yarn add -D @types/redis
```

#### 6.2 Create Redis Service
**File:** `src/services/RedisService.ts`

**Core Functionality:**
- Game state caching with TTL
- Player session management
- Room code management
- Rate limiting support
- Connection management

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation (30 minutes) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 7.1 Create Database Tests
**File:** `src/tests/database.test.ts`

**Test Cases:**
- Game creation and retrieval
- Player management
- Card operations
- Timeline operations
- Error handling scenarios

#### 7.2 Run Tests
```bash
yarn add -D jest @types/jest ts-jest
yarn test database.test.ts
```

### Phase 8: Documentation & Verification (15 minutes) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 8.1 Create Database Documentation
**File:** `docs/Database Schema Documentation.md`

**Documentation Sections:**
- Model overview and relationships
- Index strategy for performance
- Data flow patterns
- Best practices and conventions

#### 8.2 Verify Setup
```bash
npx prisma studio
npx prisma db seed
```

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Models
- **Game**: `id`, `roomCode`, `state`, `phase`, `maxPlayers`, timestamps
- **Card**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `chronologicalValue`, `difficulty`, `category`
- **Player**: `id`, `name`, `gameId`, `handCards`, `isCurrentTurn`, `score`
- **TimelineCard**: `id`, `gameId`, `cardId`, `position`, `placedAt`

### Key Relationships
- Game → Player (one-to-many)
- Game → TimelineCard (one-to-many)
- Card → TimelineCard (one-to-many)
- Player → Game (many-to-one)
