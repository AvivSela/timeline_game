### WebSocket Events
- `join-game`: Player joins game
- `place-card`: Card placement attempt
- `turn-changed`: Turn rotation
- `game-updated`: Game state changes
- `player-joined/left`: Player connection events

---

## Success Criteria

The POC will be considered successful when:

1. **Working Game Loop**: Players can create, join, play, and complete a game
2. **Real-time Multiplayer**: 2-4 players can play simultaneously with real-time updates
3. **Educational Value**: Players learn about chronological ordering through gameplay
4. **Technical Foundation**: Clean architecture that can be extended for future phases
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface that doesn't require extensive instructions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket Complexity**: Start with basic Socket.io implementation
- **State Synchronization**: Use server-authoritative approach from the beginning
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize as needed during development
- **ORM Learning Curve**: Start with Prisma's simple API and gradually use advanced features
- **Database Performance**: Use proper indexing and query optimization from the start

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick strictly to POC features
- **Integration Issues**: Test integration points early in each sprint
- **Dependencies**: Identify and address blocking dependencies early

## ORM Setup and Best Practices

### Prisma Configuration
```typescript
// prisma/schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// Models defined in Database Schema section above
```

### Database Service Layer
```typescript
// services/DatabaseService.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

class DatabaseService {
  private prisma: PrismaClient

  constructor() {
    this.prisma = new PrismaClient({
      log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
    })
  }

  async createGame(roomCode: string, state: any) {
    return this.prisma.game.create({
      data: {
        roomCode,
        state,
        phase: 'WAITING'
      }
    })
  }

  async findGameByRoomCode(roomCode: string) {
    return this.prisma.game.findUnique({
      where: { roomCode },
      include: {
        players: true,
        timeline: {
          include: { card: true }
        }
      }
    })
  }

  async updateGameState(gameId: string, state: any) {
    return this.prisma.game.update({
      where: { id: gameId },
      data: { state, updatedAt: new Date() }
    })
  }
}
```

### Migration and Seeding
```bash
# Initial setup
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed data
npx prisma db seed

# Production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Next Steps After POC

Once the POC is complete and validated, the next phases will focus on:

1. **Phase 1**: Educational enhancements (hints, analytics, teacher tools)
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced features (adaptive learning, collaboration, LMS integration)

The POC provides the foundation for these advanced features while proving the core concept works.
