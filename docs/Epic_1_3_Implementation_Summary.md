# Epic 1.3: Basic Drag & Drop - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Epic 1.3: Basic Drag & Drop functionality for the Timeline Game project. This epic focused on creating the foundational drag and drop system that allows users to move cards from a source area to a timeline with visual feedback and state management.

## Components Implemented

### 1. useDragAndDrop Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages HTML5 drag and drop functionality with custom visual feedback
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom drag image creation with rotation and scaling effects
  - Drag state management (isDragging, draggedCard, dragOffset, dragStartPosition)
  - Event handlers for drag start, end, over, and drop events
  - Cursor state management (grab → grabbing → grab)
  - Visual feedback with 5-degree rotation and 1.05x scaling during drag
  - Proper cleanup of drag images and state

### 2. InsertionZone Component (`frontend/src/components/timeline/InsertionZone.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides visual feedback zones for card placement on the timeline
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple visual states (inactive, highlighted, active, valid/invalid)
  - Dynamic helper text generation based on timeline position
  - Visual indicators (plus icon, checkmark, X icon)
  - Pulse animations for active states
  - Accessibility support with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
  - Drop event handling with card data parsing

### 3. useTimelineState Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useTimelineState.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages the complete timeline state including placed cards, available cards, and insertion zones
- **Key Features**:
  - State management for placed cards, available cards, drag state, and insertion zones
  - Card placement and removal functionality
  - Automatic insertion zone generation and helper text
  - Timeline validation with chronological order checking
  - State persistence to localStorage
  - Timeline statistics (completion percentage, card counts)
  - Reset functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Drag and Drop System
- **HTML5 Drag and Drop API**: Utilized native browser drag and drop capabilities
- **Custom Drag Image**: Created programmatically with card information and styling
- **Visual Effects**: Rotation (5°), scaling (1.05x), opacity changes, and enhanced shadows
- **State Management**: Comprehensive drag state tracking with offset calculations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dataTransfer and invalid card data

### Insertion Zones
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Zones automatically adjust based on placed cards
- **Helper Text Logic**:
  - Empty timeline: "Start timeline here"
  - Edge zones: "Before [year]" or "After [year]"
  - Middle zones: "Between [year1] and [year2]"
- **Visual States**:
  - Inactive: Gray border, plus icon
  - Highlighted: Blue border, hover effects
  - Active Valid: Green border, checkmark icon, pulse animation
  - Active Invalid: Red border, X icon, pulse animation

### State Management
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes use immutable patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate visual feedback for better UX
- **Persistence**: Automatic localStorage saving and loading
- **Validation**: Real-time chronological order validation
- **Statistics**: Live calculation of completion metrics

### Animations
- Duration: 200ms for state transitions
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- GPU acceleration with `transform3d`
- Pulse animations for active states

### Spacing
- 8px grid system
- 16px gaps between cards
- 24px padding around containers
- Responsive breakpoints: 768px, 1024px, 1440px

## Accessibility Features

### ARIA Support
- Proper role attributes for interactive elements
- Descriptive aria-labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast color combinations
- Clear visual state indicators
- Reduced motion support considerations
- Screen reader friendly text content

## Performance Optimizations

### Drag Performance
- Custom drag image to reduce DOM manipulation
- GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth animations
- Efficient state updates with React.memo considerations
- Debounced zone updates to prevent excessive re-renders

### State Management
- Memoized selectors for derived state
- Immutable updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient localStorage operations
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

## Integration Points

### Existing Components
- **TimelineCard**: Enhanced with drag event handlers
- **CardSourceArea**: Integrated with drag initiation
- **TimelineContainer**: Supports drag and drop operations
- **TimelineBackbone**: Visual foundation for timeline

### Future Extensions
