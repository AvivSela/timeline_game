  - Game creation and management
  - Player operations and validation
  - Card operations and filtering
  - Timeline operations
  - Utility functions
- [x] All tests passing successfully
- [x] Configured Jest with TypeScript support

### Phase 8: Documentation & Verification ✅
- [x] Created comprehensive database schema documentation
- [x] Documented all models, relationships, and indexes
- [x] Added performance optimization guidelines
- [x] Included troubleshooting and maintenance information
- [x] Verified database setup with Prisma Studio
- [x] Confirmed seed data is properly loaded

## 📊 Database Statistics

### Historical Events Loaded: 38
- **Ancient History**: 5 events (Great Pyramid, Roman Empire, etc.)
- **Middle Ages**: 5 events (Crusades, Magna Carta, etc.)
- **Renaissance**: 5 events (Gutenberg Bible, Columbus, etc.)
- **Industrial Revolution**: 5 events (Steam Engine, American Revolution, etc.)
- **19th Century**: 5 events (Darwin, Civil War, etc.)
- **20th Century**: 8 events (Flight, World Wars, Moon Landing, etc.)
- **21st Century**: 5 events (9/11, iPhone, COVID-19, etc.)

### Sample Data Created:
- 1 sample game with room code `TEST123`
- 2 sample players (Alice and Bob)
- 2 sample timeline cards (Great Pyramid and ChatGPT)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Features:
- **4 Core Models**: Game, Card, Player, TimelineCard
- **2 Enums**: GamePhase, Difficulty
- **8 Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Cascade Deletes**: Proper data cleanup
- **JSON Fields**: Flexible state storage
- **Timestamps**: Full audit trail

### Service Layer Features:
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Connection Management**: Proper resource cleanup
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for performance
- **Validation**: Input validation and business logic

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Database Indexes**: Strategic indexing for common queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Redis Caching**: Fast access to frequently used data
- **Query Optimization**: Proper use of Prisma includes

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Test Categories:
- **Game Operations**: 4 tests (create, find, update, phase)
- **Player Operations**: 5 tests (add, validation, hand, turn, scoring)
- **Card Operations**: 4 tests (random, difficulty, category, retrieval)
- **Timeline Operations**: 3 tests (add, get, remove)
- **Utility Operations**: 3 tests (count, full check, data retrieval)

### Test Results:
- ✅ **19/19 tests passing**
- ✅ **78.72% statement coverage** for core database operations
- ✅ **62.5% branch coverage** for conditional logic
- ✅ **80.95% function coverage** for all methods
- ✅ **Error handling** validated
- ✅ **Edge cases** covered
- ✅ **Coverage reporting** configured with HTML and LCOV output
